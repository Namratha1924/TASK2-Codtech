## Overview
This document outlines the collaborative workflow followed in creating and refining the Weather App User Interface (UI). It highlights key steps including project creation, sharing with team members, collaborative commenting, and version control.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Project Creation
- **Tool Used**: Figma (a collaborative UI/UX design tool).
- **Initial Setup**: The Weather App project was created as a new file in Figma. This file served as the central workspace for design iterations.
- **Sectioning**: The project was divided into sections (e.g., "Current Weather" and "15-Day Forecast") to organize design elements clearly.

### 2. Sharing the Project with Team Members
- **Team Collaboration**: The project file was shared with team members by inviting them via their registered Figma accounts.
- **Access Permissions**: Team members were granted editing rights, enabling them to make design changes, add comments, and review updates collaboratively.

### 3. Collaborative Commenting
- **Comment Features**:
  - Team members provided feedback by adding comments directly on the design elements.
  - Comments were used to suggest improvements, point out inconsistencies, and highlight areas requiring further attention.
- **Resolution Workflow**:
  - Once a comment was addressed, it was marked as "Resolved."
  - Unresolved comments served as reminders for pending tasks.

### 4. Version Control
- **Version History**:
  - Figma's version history feature was utilized to track changes.
  - Each significant update was saved as a version, with clear labels such as "Version 1.0" or "Version 2.0."
- **Restoration Capability**:
  - The team could revert to previous versions if required, ensuring flexibility and control over design decisions.
- **Change Documentation**:
  - Key changes, like modifying the font size or updating the color scheme, were documented with timestamps and contributor details.

### 5. Finalizing the Design
- **Approval Process**:
  - After iterative feedback and revisions, the final design was reviewed and approved by all team members.
- **Handoff**:
  - The finalized UI design was prepared for handoff to developers, including annotations for design specifications like color codes, font sizes, and spacing.

## Conclusion
This collaborative workflow ensured efficient teamwork, high-quality design iterations, and smooth project management. By leveraging Figma's collaborative features like sharing, commenting, and version control, the team successfully delivered a user-friendly Weather App interface.
